# Topics implemented:
1. Terrains and Meshes		- Probuilder is used to generate the maze. Many meshes, prefabs, and materials are used to populate the maze.

2. Scripting and OOP			- With the exception of "Movement.cs", minimal external sources are referred to. No external Unity
					asset scripts are used.

3. Animation and Motion		- Animations done for players and enemies. Player could move, jump, and dash with animations accompanying
					these movements.

4. Physics and Particles		- Particles are added to checkpoints and light sources. Warning particles are added to warn player
					of enemy's spawn places.

5. Audio and Game Mechanics		- SFXs for enemies and players implemented. Background song added. Game mechanics include 3 hearts,
					dash and jump, respawning.

6. User Interface and HUD		- Title and pause menu implemented (with control logic to flow between them). HUD with health bar and
					basic instructions graphics added.
